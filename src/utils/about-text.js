export const ABOUT_TEXT = 'ALICE detector is a 10,000 ton and 26 metres long device dedicated to the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities. The idea of enhancing Large Hadron Collider with a specialized heavy-ion collider was first proposed in 1992 and the collaboration was finally formed in 1993.\n' +

    'ALICE is optimized for Pb-Pb heavy-ion nuclei collisions. Under such circumstances, quark-gluon plasma is formed. It is a phase of matter in which the quarks and gluons are separated (decomposition occurs). Quark-gluon plasma is thought to have been present a few microseconds after the Big Bang, before the quarks and gluons formed protons and neutrons and proceeded to form the universe. ALICE collaboration examines quark-gluon plasma as it cools down, and quarks and gluons begin to confine. The understanding of deconfinement and properties of quark-gluon plasma are important milestones in researching quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\n' +

    'The detector is located in a cavern 56 metres below ground close to the village of St Genis-Pouilly in France. The control team consists of more than 1000 scientists from over 100 physics institutes in 30 countries. ' +
    'Results of their work lead directly to the better understanding of the matter where this knowledge proves extremely useful in numerous fields of research.'
